# Project_2
This project automates the NDOT concrete mix design by translating the “Mix Design” excel sheet logic into a Python-based system. The program collects the client’s numerical inputs for different mechanical properties and design parameters, then applies the absolute volume method to calculate mix proportions for one cubic yard of concrete. All calculations are implemented through Jupyter Notebook-Python functions to ensure accurate and consistent results. The program generates a professionally formatted weight chart and was validated using four researched concrete mix scenarios. This automation improves accuracy and supports future integration into a web-based engineering tool.
